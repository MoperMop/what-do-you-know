# What Do You Know?
My conceptual art project.


## Takeaway
You always need to keep in mind that you can't be 100% sure of the information we're recieving.

### Requirements for Takeaway
The user needs to be invested.


## Plan
1. The user will be asked to answer some questions with some information within a time limit.
2. After answering the questions, the user will find out that the information they were given was incorrect, and wil be given the chance to redo the questions with better information.
3. Repeat 1-2 until time is up.
